Belvedere Avenue. Chinquapin Run burbles through the park that bounds the neighborhood on the east, from which it derives its name. Lined by tall trees and rolling lawns, the well-kept park is at once a never-tiring romping ground for children, a place for neighborhood picnics and other functions, and a peaceful scenic stroll. The park includes a traditional playground, with awnings, seesaws, slide and basketball and areas. In addition, sandwiched between the new Northern Parkway and Lake Avenue, is an innovative and imaginative city playground. The area is anchored by three landmarks. The Govans Presbyterian Church is a beautiful old stone church sitting on 8 acres of land, up a small knell on the west side of York Road. The church has been a leader in the community, providing an excellent pre-school used by many local families, and featuring a Senior Center with extensive offerings. The tolling of its bells can be heard throughout the community. The Senator Theatre, one of the finest Art Deco buildings in Baltimore, is probably the best-known landmark. The Senator features quality movies and special events and hosts premieres of films shot in Baltimore. The Belvedere Shopping Center, now called Belvedere Square, was opened in 1948. It, along with the rest of the commercial district, provides shopping, dining and services to area residents.",

Built in the 1900's, most homes feature beautiful hardwoods, fireplaces, large backyards, and plenty of privacy. Neighbors old and new have fallen in love with Dorchester, thus renovations are rapidily increasing. Residents from a diverse mix of cultures, religions, and socioeconomic backgrounds work together to return Dorchester to its glory. These amenities could explain why so many residents have called Dorchester home for more than 30 years!",

The neighborhood has a strong local business climate and an abundance of well-known cultural and educational resources, being the home to such institutions as the Johns Hopkins University and the Baltimore Museum of Art. The Old Goucher Neighborhood, formerly South Charles Village, is well known for its mix of ethnic restaurants, white-collar professional firms, and non-profits, contained in its late Victorian streetscape. Lovely Lane Methodist Church and the handsome granite buildings nearby were part of the original campus of Goucher College, which moved to Towson in the 1950s. Howard Street has become Baltimore's \"\"Automotive Alley\"\" with its heavy concentration of car-related services. And St. Paul Street, around the corner from JHU, has evolved into a student-orientated retail strip. Another neighborhood association identifies itself as a separate organized identity within Charles Village. The Peabody Heights Resident Homeowners Alliance represents the blocks between 25 and 31streets, bounded by Maryland Avenue and Guilford Avenue east and west, respectively. Greater Charles Village is generally considered to include the Charles Village, Abell, Harwood and Old Goucher Neighborhoods.",

        "description": "Federal Hill is a neighborhood primarily of brick, late 19th Century homes. Many (but not all) have been rehabbed into modern residences in the past 15-20 years. Rehabbing continues, and some homes are still available at bargain prices for those interested in investing sweat capital. There are also some apartment houses and a few old residences divided into apartments. Federal Hill is a cohesive, inclusive neighborhood with a strong community sense which works hard to preserve its individuality. The neighborhood is a federal historic district, and the northern portion has strict preservation and urban renewal requirements. There are still many residents who are second and third generation South Baltimoreans who are equally proud of their heritage. Most homes are owner-occupied, but there is a good supply of rental housing as well. To the South there is the Port Covington Shopping Center (WalMart and Sams Club), with access to I-95 N&S and Route 295 right within reach. Several of the most active real estate brokers live in the neighborhood and know it well. We welcome all who are committed to urban living. The larger neighborhood is generally referred to as being comprised of two parts, Federal Hill and West Federal Hill. West Federal Hill refers to the area below Cross Street and west of Hanover, while Federal Hill generally designates the area bounded by Key Highway and Cross. Both areas have their own neighborhood associations which are very active in the community.",

Medfield residents enjoy below-average crime, close proximity to transit and I-83, and the attractions of neighboring Hampden, all in a quiet, close-knit community. Medfield is less than a mile from Loyola College and less than 2 miles from Johns Hopkins Homewood campus. Singles and young families are discovering that Hampden's small town atmosphere and proximity to downtown make it one of the most desirable of Baltimore's neighborhoods. Hampden is great place to live, work and play. It is also a fun place to visit with scores of elegant to funky stores, eclectic restaurants and special events like the Hon Fest. Hampden is a uniquely authentic experience that's happening every day! Woodberry is country living with city convenience! Woodberry comprises five neighborhoods: Woodberry/TV Hill, Park Hill, Greenspring Trails, Brick Hill and Clipper Mill. Homes dating from the 1880’s are listed on the National Historic Registry and stand harmoniously with newer townhomes and ultra-contemporary park homes. Many of the Woodberry mills have been converted to studios, condos and apartments, while other buildings continue as commercial use. The Meadow Mill building, seen from I-83 houses an athletic club, a local theatre troop, a commercial baker and various commercial office spaces. The beautiful Shiloh Church, also seen from I-83, dates from 1850. The Woodberry Kitchen and adjacent artist studios are major destination points, with Druid Hill Park and the Jones Falls Bike Path offering recreational opportunities for local residents. Woodberry remains a quiet community with easy access to I-83 and the Light Rail. Remington is a diverse, affordable residential community with deep roots in Baltimore’s history. Row houses in a variety of sizes and styles characterize the neighborhood. Located west of Charles Street and east of the Jones Falls, Remington is well served by buses, light rail, trains, and the Jones Falls Expressway. Shopping opportunities are within walking distance, and the Shuttle Bug links Remington to the many services found in neighboring Hampden.",

These teams take advantage of the large neighborhood park that features several fields, courts, playgrounds, and even a refreshment stand. Bordering residential Violetville are an office and business park, and industrial park, and a commercial area straddling the conveniently located I-95 corridor (Caton Avenue Exit). For residents, this can mean a short walk to work or public transportation.",

        "description": "The neighborhood is comprised of approximately 1600 residences surrounded by attractions, natural and man made. On the Northwest edge, Luckman Park is a lovely setting in which to play tennis, picnic or walk through the woods. At the other (southeast) end of the neighborhood, the University of Baltimore Fields include playing fields for lacrosse and rugby, and a golf driving range open to the public. The Mount Washington Village, part of the eastern section of the neighborhood, includes restaurants, salons, clothing stores, specialty shops and even a veterinarian. Also in the village is Baltimore Clayworks, a nationally recognized non-profit educational art institution that promotes the exploration of ceramics in the setting of an old library building. Across the Jones Falls from the village is the Mount Washington Mill, an historic mill complex along the Jones Falls reborn as a shopping center including a Whole Foods natural foods grocery store, Starbucks, Framin Place, Amazing Glaze and Smith & Hawken. Mt. Washington boasts two swim clubs: the Mt. Washington Swim Club (contact Cindy Freeman, 410-664-7774 or swimmw@yahoo.com),a neighborhood non-profit summer time swim club, and Meadowbrook, a year-round swim club and fitness center with Olympic-size swimming pools that actually produce Olympic swimmers such as Anita Nall. To the south is the beautiful Cylburn Arboretum, which includes specimen trees, well marked nature trails and bird watching. The Mt. Washington Arboretum is also a lovely venue for walks and learning about native flora. The neighborhood is served by the Light Rail, with service to Camden Yards and the Airport, and several bus lines. Major employers in or near Mt. Washington include the Johns Hopkins Conference Center, Mt. Washington Pediatric Hospital and Sinai Hospital.",

Many residents have lived here their whole lives, and many others have arrived in the past decade or even more recently. South Baltimore neighbors, whether they are young or old, of modest means or affluent, new to the neighborhood or lifers, share a community that combines Baltimore comfort and charm with nearby convenience and entertainment, such as the stadium complex and the Inner Harbor, as well as many benefits right here in SOBO. SOBO kids can attend two highly-rated public schools, Federal Hill Prep and Thomas Johnson Elementary and Middle School. We host a library branch on Light Street, the newly renovated Swann Park, an active recreation center, and a public pool at nearby Riverside Park. South Baltimore is a safe neighborhood for kids and their parents. SOBO adults enjoy the historic Cross Street Market, a year-round variety of street festivals and block parties, and the many shops and services of the business district. With walkable streets, several bus routes (including the Purple Line of the Charm City Circulator), neighborhood-based Zip Cars, and easy access to the MARC train and Light Rail, getting around is incredibly easy. The residents of South Baltimore are served by the South Baltimore Neighborhood Association (formally organized as the South Baltimore Improvement Committee). The SBNA has proudly led the revitalization of the neighborhood while protecting it from rampant gentrification. The resulting balance has created a harmonious diversity that is a hallmark of the South Baltimore community.",
